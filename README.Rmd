# craneur

The goal of craneur is to provide an easy way to Create your own "R Archive Network". 

## Install {craneur}

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("craneur", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
```

## Why would you use `{craneur}`?

Creating your own R archive repository can be useful for: 

+ Not depending on GitHub for your dev packages 
+ Internal uses in your company, lab, university... 
+ Because you're a nerd and find it cool

## How does it work? 

A R archive repo is a location where you can download R packages with the `install.packages` function. 

This location is composed of, roughly: 

+ a `PACKAGES` file
+ the `tar.gz` of your packages

These elements should be put inside a `src/contrib` folder. 

Once you've installed that, you can do : 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pkg", repos = "../craneur", type = "source")
```

For example :

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("attempt", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
```

## Here comes `{craneur}`

`craneur` provides a user-friendly API for creating this skeleton : `PACKAGES` file, tar.gz, and a minimal `index.html`.

```{r}
library(craneur)
colin <- craneur:::Craneur$new("Colin")
colin$add_package(path = "../craneur_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", name = "craneur")
colin$add_package(path = "../jekyllthat_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", name = "jekyllthat")
colin$add_package(path = "../tidystringdist_0.1.2.tar.gz", name = "tidystringdist")
colin$add_package(path = "../attempt_0.2.1.tar.gz", name = "attempt")
colin$add_package(path = "../rpinterest_0.4.0.tar.gz", name = "rpinterest")
colin$add_package(path = "../rgeoapi_1.2.0.tar.gz", name = "rgeoapi")
colin$add_package(path = "../proustr_0.3.0.9000.tar.gz", name = "proustr")
colin$add_package(path = "../languagelayeR_1.2.3.tar.gz", name = "languagelayeR")
colin$add_package(path = "../fryingpane_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", name = "fryingpane")
colin$add_package(path = "../dockerfiler_0.1.1.tar.gz", name = "dockerfiler")
colin$add_package(path = "../devaddins_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz", name = "devaddins")
colin
```

Create it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
colin$write(path = ".")
```

This creates a "src/contrib" folder, and copies all the tar.gz into this folder. 

For a bulk import, you can : 

```{r}
colin <- Craneur$new("Colin")
lapply(list.files("../", pattern = "tar.gz", full.names = TRUE), function(x) colin$add_package(x))
```

### Put on your sever

You can now put the full "src/contrib" folder onto your server. 

For example, if I put "src/contrib" at the root of "https://colinfay.me", here the index: https://colinfay.me/src/contrib/ 

You can now install with : 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("craneur", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("jekyllthat", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("tidystringdist", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("attempt", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("rpinterest", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("rgeoapi", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("proustr", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("languagelayeR", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("fryingpane", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("dockerfiler", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
install.packages("devaddins", repos = "https://colinfay.me", type = "source")
```

## Personnalise home page

You can rewrite your index.html by reknitting the index.Rmd you'll find in the directory.
